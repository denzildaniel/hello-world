My initiation into GitHub

Hi! Denzil here. I dabble with coding in MATLAB, R and now recently, Python and C++. I primarily use programming languages to get some repetitive tasks done quickly, tasks that I otherwise can do manually, but would take forever to get done. Most recently I used Python to format 920 contacts exported from my google account to a version that I could easily import into an 8 year old Nokia phone running on the Series 40 operating system. I am a research student working close to the Indian Himalayas and exploring how data (observational and from secondary sources) can help us better manage water for basic consumptive needs.
